> Automated refactoring for [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).

Currently supports:

* Rename local / var / data / resource across all files in a config
* Diff preview of changes
* Adding `moved` blocks for resource renames to avoid `state mv` in Terraform 1.1

See [refactor.tf](https://refactor.tf/refactor/2021/08/26/todo.html) for more refactoring recipes.
